# Evil-Hangman
An unassuming game of hangman

To the user this appears to be a normal game of hangman.

On the back end there is a sinister AI making the game as hard as possible.

Each time the user makes a guess the AI will dynamically generate the largest list of words consistent with the guesses given so far.
